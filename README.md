# SS13 remake

Welcome! This is my attempt at creating an SS13 remake using node.js.

## Installing

Install node.js and NPM (npm should automatically be installed when you install node.js) and run `npm install` in the root directory of the repo and client_src. Also, run `npm install -g gulp-cli`. To build the client, run `gulp build` in the client_src directory.

## Running

Run `node index.js` in the root directory of the repository. To join the server connect to `localhost:8080` using a web browser.
